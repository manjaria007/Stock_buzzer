# Stock_buzzer

Started developing initial demo of the product with very simple, rudimentary concepts to test if the idea could work.
Focussed on accessing stock data and displaying that through frontend.
Program lacked whole notification system. The Program is able to take in a ticker symbol input from user and display current price of stock that allows user to determine their limits for stock. limit lists are sorted so that closest one to current value is at top of list and displayed at top of list.
In addition, type in new ticker symbols to overwrite/delete old progress so that you can work with a new stock.
